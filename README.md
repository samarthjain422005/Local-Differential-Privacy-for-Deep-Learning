# Local Differential Privacy for Deep Learning:
For a given dataset, we add a randomization module following certain algorithms in the Convolutional Neural Network sandwitched between the initial data-processing and fully-connected module of the CNN , and then compare the accuracy of this Differentially Private CNN.
# Output
- Train and test accuracy for DPCNN in MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
- Plot for accuracy vs epoch for DPCNN and NPCNN
# Installation Guide
``` 
pip! install tensorflow
```

# Dependencies:

- numpy 
- matplotlib
- tensorflow
